## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Live runtime spec_version changes are recorded

The live-data component SHALL persist the last-seen live runtime `spec_version`
(with its reference block and observation time) and SHALL record a durable
upgrade event whenever a validated live chain-head response reports a
`spec_version` different from the last recorded one. The upgrade record SHALL be
written only from a live, typed-validated response (never from stale or
unvalidated data) and SHALL capture the previous `spec_version`, the new
`spec_version`, and the reference block. A restart SHALL NOT re-emit an upgrade
for an already-recorded `spec_version`.

#### Scenario: New live spec_version records an upgrade

- **WHEN** a validated live chain-head reports a `spec_version` different from the
  last recorded one
- **THEN** an upgrade event is persisted with the previous `spec_version`, the new
  `spec_version`, and the reference block, and the last-seen value is advanced

#### Scenario: Unchanged spec_version records no upgrade

- **WHEN** a validated live chain-head reports the same `spec_version` as the last
  recorded one
- **THEN** no upgrade event is written and the last-seen observation time is
  updated

#### Scenario: Upgrade detection never uses stale data

- **WHEN** a live chain-head request fails or its response fails validation
- **THEN** no `spec_version` upgrade is recorded and the last recorded value is
  left unchanged
