# Atlas

Self-hosted, single-user Bittensor knowledge and live-data agent built on Hermes,
running on a Raspberry Pi. Built methodically in gated phases via OpenSpec.

**This README is the orientation map. Authoritative sources it points to:**
[prd.md](prd.md) (full product requirements), [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md)
(resolved/open decisions), `openspec/specs/` (accepted capability specs), and
`openspec/changes/archive/` (completed changes with their proposal/design/tasks).

## Current status (2026-07-11)

Phase 0 and the Phase 1 hardening are **complete and accepted on the device**.
No active OpenSpec changes. Next up: installing Hermes.

| Capability (accepted spec) | State |
|---|---|
| `device-inventory` | Done — read-only Pi inventory tool + clean baseline captured |
| `hardening-assessment` | Done — read-only posture assessor (11 ATLAS-ENV-003 areas) |
| `hardening-apply` | Done — 6 approved items applied + verified on the Pi |

Latest closed-loop assessment `20260711T073125Z-d52a70e9`: **ok=7, finding=0**
(remaining non-ok are 2 deferred decisions + 2 future-phase items).

## The device

- **Hardware/OS:** Raspberry Pi 5 Model B Rev 1.1, 16 GB RAM, 256 GB NVMe,
  Debian 13 (trixie), kernel 6.18, Python 3.13.
- **Access:** `ssh pi@192.168.0.150` — **key auth only** (password auth is
  disabled as of the hardening). A new session's key must be in the Pi's
  `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` to connect.
- **sudo needs a password** (no passwordless sudo). Automation must never enter
  it: privileged steps are run by the operator, or by tooling only when
  `sudo -n` already succeeds from a cached session. Never put a password on a
  command line.
- **Repo on the Pi:** cloned at `~/atlas`, kept current with `git pull`
  (remote: `github.com/vanlabs-dev/atlas`). This is the live working tree.
- **Applied hardening:** SSH key-only + X11Forwarding off; rpcbind and avahi
  disabled; nftables default-deny inbound (SSH allowed), enabled at boot;
  unattended security updates on (no auto-reboot).

## Repo layout

```
prd.md                     # governing product requirements (source of truth)
docs/decisions.md          # resolved + open decisions (check before re-asking)
inventory/                 # device-inventory tool (read-only), tests, schema, docs
hardening/                 # hardening-assessment tool (read-only)
hardening/apply/           # hardening-apply scripts (the ONLY device-mutating code)
openspec/specs/            # accepted capability specs
openspec/changes/          # active changes (none now) + archive/
var/                        # gitignored: device-sensitive inventory/assessment outputs
```

## Working conventions

- **OpenSpec workflow:** propose (`/opsx:propose`) → apply (`/opsx:apply`) →
  archive (`/opsx:archive`). One change per narrowly-scoped capability; see
  PRD §22 for the recommended sequence.
- **Read-only vs mutating:** `inventory/` and `hardening/` (except
  `hardening/apply/`) never change the device. `hardening/apply/` is the only
  code that mutates, and only applies operator-approved items.
- **Fail closed / no assumptions:** tools report explicit unknowns
  (`permission-denied`, `unsupported-on-device`) rather than guessing.
- **Secrets never enter the repo, logs, or chat.** Outputs are redacted and
  written 0600 into gitignored `var/`.
- **Privileged assessment:** reading the firewall and `/etc/ssl/private` needs
  root, so full hardening acceptance runs the inventory + assessor under `sudo`
  (produces root-owned outputs). See [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md)
  "Operational notes".
- **Tests run off-device;** WSL is used as a throwaway Linux environment for
  integration runs. The Pi itself is the acceptance environment.

## Next step

`atlas-phase-1-hermes-baseline` (install Hermes). All Phase 0/1 decisions are
now resolved in [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md) (2026-07-11): hosted
models allowed, first candidate **Grok via X OAuth** (~$20/mo, interactive
latency), LAN-only, all telemetry disabled, backup target restic/rsync to a
LAN machine (manual; restore test still owed before production).

**Install mode:** the operator runs the Hermes install and interactive setup
manually on the Pi. The OpenSpec change ships only a read-only post-install
verification script for the ATLAS-HERMES-005 acceptance baseline.
